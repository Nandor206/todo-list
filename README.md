# TODO list
Things I should do to improve in programming. Ideas are coming from different sources, sometimes from me.

## Rust - CLI
#### password generator âœ…
Should take in multiple arguments:
- lenght, name (to store passwords locally)
- if no arguments added -> read most recent passwords
#### anime watcher (anilist api, ani-skip api)
